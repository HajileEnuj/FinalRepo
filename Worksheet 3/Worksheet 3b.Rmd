```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
1. Create a data frame using the table below.
a. Write the codes.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
Respondents <- c(seq(1,20))
Sex <- c(2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2)
Father_Occupation <- c(1,3,3,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,2,1,3,3,1,3,1,2,1)
PersonsAtHome <- c(5,7,3,8,5,9,6,7,8,4,7,5,4,7,8,8,3,11,7,6)
SiblingsAtSchool <- c(6,4,4,1,2,1,5,3,1,2,3,2,5,5,2,1,2,5,3,2)
TypeOfHouses <- c (1,2,3,1,1,3,3,1,2,3,2,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2)

data_display <- data.frame(Respondents, Sex,Father_Occupation,PersonsAtHome,SiblingsAtSchool,TypeOfHouses)
data_display
```


b. Describe the data. Get the structure or the summary of the data
The dataset consists of responses from 20 individuals, providing details about their gender, with 7 males and 13 females. It also includes information about their fathers' occupations (coded as 1, 2, or 3), household sizes (ranging from 3 to 11 people), school-going siblings (ranging from 1 to 6), and the type of houses they reside in (coded as 1, 2, or 3). Conducting further analysis on these variables can uncover valuable insights.
summary(data_display)

c. Is the mean number of siblings attending is 5? 
No.

d. Extract the 1st two rows and then all the columns using the subsetting functions.
Write the codes and its output.
```{r}
data1 <- subset (data_display)[1:2, 2:6, drop=FALSE]
data1
```


e. Extract 3rd and 5th row with 2nd and 4th column. Write the codes and its result.
```{r}
data2 <- data_display[c(3,5), c(2,4)]
data2
```


f. Select the variable types of houses then store the vector that results as types_houses.
Write the codes.
```{r}
types_houses <- data_display[c(6)]
types_houses
```

g. Select only all Males respondent that their father occupation was farmer. Write the
codes and its output.
```{r}
selected_data <- data_display %>% select(1:6)
data3 <- selected_data[data_display$Sex == 1,]
data3
```


h.
```{r}
female <- selected_data[data_display$SiblingsAtSchool >= 5,]
female
```


2. Write a R program to create an empty data frame. Using the following codes:
```{r}
df = data.frame(Ints=integer(),
                Doubles=double(),Characters=character(),
                Logicals=logical(),
                Factors=factor(),
                stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
print("Structure of the empty dataframe:")
print(str(df))
```


3. Create a .csv file of this. Save it as HouseholdData.csv
a. Import the csv file into the R environment. Write the codes.
```{r}
RespondentsNew<-c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
SexNew<-c("Male", "Female", "Female", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Female", "Male", "Female", "Male")
FathersOccupationNew<-c(1,2,3,3,1,2,2,3,1,3)
PeAtHomeNew<-c(5,7,3,8,6,4,4,2,11,6)
SibAtSchoolNew<-c(2,3,0,5,2,3,1,2,6,2)
TypesofHousesNew<-c("Wood","Congrete","Congrete","Wood", "Semi-Congrete","Semi-Congrete","Wood","Semi-Congrete", "Semi-Congrete", "Congrete")
HouseholdData<-data.frame(
  RespondentsNew,
  SexNew,
  FathersOccupationNew,
  PeAtHomeNew, 
  SibAtSchoolNew, 
  TypesofHousesNew
)
HouseholdData

library(readr)
csv_file <- "HouseholdData.csv"
write.csv(HouseholdData, file = csv_file)
HouseholdData <- read.csv("HouseholdData.csv")

```


b. Convert the Sex into factor using factor() function and change it into integer.[Legend:
Male = 1 and Female = 2]. Write the R codes and its output.
```{r}
data_display1 <- factor(HouseholdData$SexNew, levels = c("Male" = 1, "Female" = 2))
sex_mapping <- c("Male" = 1, "Female" = 2)
data_display1<-as.integer(sex_mapping[HouseholdData$SexNew])
unique(data_display1)
unique(HouseholdData$SexNew)
```


c. Convert the Type of Houses into factor and change it into integer. [Legend: Wood
= 1; Congrete = 2; Semi-Congrete = 3]. Write the R codes and its output.
```{r}
data_display2 <- factor(HouseholdData$TypesofHousesNew, levels = c("Wood" = 1, "Congrete" = 2,"Semi-Congrete" = 3))
sex_mapping2 <- c("Wood" = 1, "Congrete" = 2,"Semi-Congrete" = 3)
data_display2 <- as.integer(sex_mapping2[HouseholdData$TypesofHousesNew])
unique(data_display2)
unique(HouseholdData$TypesofHousesNew)

```


d. On fatherâ€™s occupation, factor it as Farmer = 1; Driver = 2; and Others = 3. What
is the R code and its output?
```{r}
data_display3 <- factor(HouseholdData$FathersOccupationNew, labels=c("Farmer" = 1, "Driver" = 2,"Others" = 3))
sex_mapping3 <- c("Farmer" = 1, "Driver" = 2,"Others" = 3)
data_display3 <- as.integer(sex_mapping3[HouseholdData$FathersOccupationNew])
unique(data_display3)
unique(HouseholdData$FathersOccupationNew)
```


e. Select only all females respondent that has a father whose occupation is driver. Write
the codes and its output.
```{r}
selected_data3 <- HouseholdData %>% select(2,3,4)
data4 <- selected_data3[HouseholdData$FathersOccupationNew == 2, ]
data4
```


f. Select the respondents that have greater than or equal to 5 number of siblings attending
school. Write the codes and its output.
```{r}
selected_data3 <- HouseholdData %>% select(2,6)
data4 <- selected_data3[HouseholdData$SibAtSchoolNew >= 5,]
data4
colnames(HouseholdData) <- c("Respondents", "Sex", "Fathers Occupation", "Persons At Home", "Siblings At School", "Type Of Houses")

```
